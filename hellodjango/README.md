In this Project we have: <br>

We started off with a barebones Django project that we generated
with django-admin startproject . We created a database and
started up Django’s development server.

Then we created a Django superuser so that we could access the
Django admin. We explored the admin UI.

Next, we added a simple Django app to the project. We called
it “homepage” and explored what files it gave us to start with.
After that, we learned about views and templates in Django.
We created our first view by subclassing TemplateView. We
connected it to a URL pattern and a simple static HTML tem-
plate.


Finally, we turned the static HTML template into a dynamic
one. We learned how to put variables into the template and
populate them in our Python code. We also learned how to call
view methods from our template.
